# Watchify_App
A movie browsing &amp; listing app in android using TMDB API and Firebase Firestore &amp; Authentication

Watchify is a movie listing & browsing app written in Kotlin by using TMDB API for movie informations, Jetpack Compose for designing UI, Firebase Auth for user authentication and Firebase Firestore for storing user related informations. Users can create an account or login to an already existing account and browse trending, top rated or now playing movies. They can also search for a specific movie by its title. There is also a favorite movie concept which users can add to or delete movies from their favorite movies list. I had lots of fun while working on this project and i also learned lots of new things such as Firebase, Coil, Retrofit and working with remote API's.
